# Design, Simulation & Testing of a 5-Stage Pipelined MIPS processor using Verilog HDL

## Introduction:
The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a RISC architecture developed by MIPS
Technologies. It was developed in the late 1980s. The MIPS instruction set is used by NEC, Nintendo, Silicon
Graphics, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation handheld System and several other computer manufacturers. It has
fixed-length 32-bit instructions and 32-bit general-purpose registers.
